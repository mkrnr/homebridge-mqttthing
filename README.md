# Homebridge MQTT-Thing Jarolift
This is a fork of [Homebridge MQTT-Thing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-mqttthing) to invert the open/closed states of the window-covering accessory in order to match the behavior of the Jarolift Dongle that uses [Jarolift_MQTT](https://github.com/madmartin/Jarolift_MQTT).

A sample config for the accessory looks like this:
```
        {
            "type": "windowCovering",
            "name": "Living Room Window Blind",
            "topics": {
                "getCurrentPosition": "stat/jarolift/shutter/0",
                "setTargetPosition": "cmd/jarolift/shutter/0"
            },
            "accessory": "mqttthing-jarolift"
        },
```

# Homebridge MQTT-Thing
[Homebridge MQTT-Thing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-mqttthing) is a plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge) allowing the integration of [many different accessory types](#supported-accessories) using MQTT.

   * [Installation](#installation)
   * [Configuration](#configuration)
   * [Supported Accessories](#supported-accessories)
   * [Release notes](docs/ReleaseNotes.md)

## Compatibility with previous versions

**From version 1.1.33, MQTT-Thing requires Node.js 14 or later.**

**From version 1.1.x, raw JavaScript values for Boolean properties are passed to MQTT apply functions.** This may change published message formats, e.g. when apply functions are used to build JSON strings.

For full details of changes please see the [Release notes](docs/ReleaseNotes.md).

## Installation
Follow the instructions in [homebridge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge) for the homebridge server installation.
This plugin is published through [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-mqttthing) and should be installed "globally" by typing:

    npm install -g homebridge-mqttthing

Installation through 
[Homebridge Config UI X](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-config-ui-x) is also supported (and recommended).

## Configuration
Configure the plugin in your homebridge `config.json` file. Most configuration settings can now also be entered using 
[Homebridge Config UI X](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-config-ui-x).

MQTT topics used fall into two categories:

   * Control topics, of the form `setXXX`, are published by MQTT-Thing in order to control device state (e.g. to turn on a light).
   * Status/notification topics, of the form `getXXX`, are published by the device to notify MQTT-Thing that something has occurred (e.g. that a sensor has detected something or a control topic action has been performed).

For further details, see [docs/Configuration.md](docs/Configuration.md) and [docs/Codecs.md](docs/Codecs.md).
